## Twitter Internship and Undergrad Interview process

We have tried to provide you everything about the Twitter internship and undergrad interview pattern, type of problems they ask. We all also know that it's not guaranteed, they will follow the same pattern every year. Let's see the pattern,

So, Process starts with ![Twitter Internship Pattern](http://eulercoder.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Twitter-internship-min.png)

- **60 Minutes - Tech Screening on [_Hackerrank_](https://www.hackerrank.com)**

  - There will be two coding problems that you have to solve in an hour.
  - Problems will be easy but you need to keep corner cases in mind.
  - This pre-screening is just to see whether a candidate is able to code or not.
  - **Possible problem types - **Strings, LinkedList, Arrays, Trees and basic ad-hoc implementation

* **Phone Interview**

  - Phone interview will be with the hiring manager
  - The hiring manager will ask you to code on a collaborative site.
  - This may last up to 45 minutes.
  - There will be few questions on your interests so that he can proceed further with team specific interviews.

- **2-3 Core Interviews with different teams**

  - In the host matching phase, you will be interviewing with different teams based on your performance and interests.
  - Sometimes the interview can be up to 3 rounds or even one if the interviewer is convinced that your interest and skills match with the requirement of the team.

* **Culture Fit Interview**

  - You must be already knowing what possible questions can be asked in cultural fit interviews.
  - Possible questions can be about the company's mission and values, team conflicts, about the manager, your personal views on things.

- **Finally The Offer Letter** - And, once you clear all these rounds, you'll receive the _**twitter internship**_ offer letter or full-time job offer depending on the role you had applied.
