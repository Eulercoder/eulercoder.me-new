I read a blog post and now I'm inspired by [John Resig](https://ejohn.org/blog/write-code-every-day/) (Who was in turn, inspired by [Jennifer Dewalt](https://jenniferdewalt.com/)), I am going to write code every day, starting today. I hope to write about my coding progress regularly on this blog.

# Why I intend on writing as I go along

- Obligate me to actually code every day (though this may not work because this blog has practically no readership)

* Keep a log of my progress over time

- Recall the reasoning I used when justifying decisions (e.g. this list describes why I decided to blog while doing this)

<!-- more -->

# What I hope to gain from this

- Better programming skills and intuition. Improved familiarity with tools, paradigms, etc.

* Improve my algorithmic knowledge.

- Learn new languages, frameworks etc. by application rather than just reading docs.

* Create some interesting projects, hopefully, some worth mentioning in a [technical interview](https://eulercoder.me/2017/07/slack-internship-sf-silicon-valley/) or something (for those "describe a time you ran into a problem when programming and how you fixed your problem" type questions)

- Spend free time more productively (as of now, coding seems like a much more useful way of spending my free time than chatting on WhatsApp or watching prank videos on YouTube)

* Meet people, become more familiar with the many programming communities on the internet.

# Ideas what to do each day

This section is more of just a brainstorm/dump of different ways I can code each day.

- Learn a new language or framework. On my to-learn list: Dart, Go, R and other JavaScript web frameworks.

* Solve problems on different Coding platforms and Interview problems.

- Play with APIs and write tools for myself and the community.

* Contribute to Open Source projects.

# What are the projects currently I'm working on

- [Charmandar](https://github.com/vicky002/Charmander): A New Bot for Slack, I'm trying to bring Google right there in your Slack channel. I'm working on it since a month and it is still under development.

* [Milotic Theme](https://github.com/vicky002/Milotic): Milotic is a new theme for all text editors available. The theme for sublime and Visual Studio is available and under development for other text Editors.

- [FCC-Downloder](https://github.com/vicky002/FCC-DL): FCC-Downloader is script to download all your solutions on [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.com).

* [FreeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.com): Next Week I'll be analyzing data of FCC. You can join the [gitter channel]() for more information about the project.

That's all!
