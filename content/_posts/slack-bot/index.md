I read a thread on Reddit about WolframAlpha API and I decided to try my hands on it. I created two slack Bot using WolframAlpha and both work very nicely see some of the best tweets from L. There is an issue with WolframAlpha API it allows only 2000 API calls in a month, you need to take their paid plans if you make heavy usages.

Ok, before we start the tutorial, I would like to mention, if you are preparing for the internship or full-time job, make sure you read one of the best guides currently available on the web: Summer Internship - The Ultimate Guide. And, if you want to contribute to Open Source projects like this Slack bot, I highly recommend you to read our Getting started with Open Source Guide.

Ok so let's get started.

This tutorial is about How to create your own Slack Bot using WolframAlpha API. I created one but you can not use it directly as it uses my App-Id and can make only 2000 API calls. (Obviously, I'm not going to spend my money)

You need basic knowledge of python to create your own Slack Bot.

Steps to create Slack Bot
Step 1: Basic Stuff
Dev WolframAlpha

Go to developer WolframAlpha and create your account.

Go to My apps section and click on Get an AppID. get App ID - Wolframalpha Eulercoder

Note your AppID. You will use this AppID to make calls.

Heroku

Go to Heroku and create an account there. Heroku allows you to deploy maximum 5 apps on the cloud for free.

Once you create your account there. Go to Dashboard.

Click on the '+' sign or 'New' on the top right, create a new app. Create new app - heroku

Write the name and click on Create App.

You will be redirected to your app page. Click on Connect to Dropbox. I'll tell you the reason why we are choosing Dropbox to for our code hosting.

Step 2: Changes in Code
Download my repo in Zip or fork it to make changes on git in the future.

Files in your directory

LICENCE: This is my LICENCE file.

Procfile: This is a startup file and tells what is the first step when we deploy our app on the cloud.

app.json: It is a manifest format for describing web apps. It declares environment variables, add-ons, and other information required to run an app on Heroku. This document describes the schema in detail.

app.py: Main part of your project.

config.py.example: config.py files store variables and other stuff which is used in your project (Flask).

requirements.txt: This file specifies Python Module dependencies. All the required modules would be downloaded first while deploying your app. Read more about it here.

Changes to be made

Open your project click on fileconfig.py.example and add your APP_ID in single quotes.

Change the name of the file from config.py.example to config.py.

If I upload my fileconfig.py on GitHub, anyone can use my APP_ID to make calls. That's the reason naming it as config.py.example :p

Step 3: Upload your code to Dropbox
open your Dropbox account.

If you have connected your account to Dropbox as mentioned in step 1. Open this link.

You'll see a folder with the name of your app on Heroku .

Open that folder and upload all your files there.

Step 4: Deploying your app on Heroku
Open your Heroku Dashboard.

Click on your app and then deploy.

In deploy tab, in Deploy changes section. Write andcommit click on Deploy.

This will download all the app dependencies. If everything is fine, you will see a green tick and your deploy is on the cloud!

Step 5: Integrate it in your team
Open your slack. It should be like.{your_slack_url}/home

Click on Integration in the upper left section.

Click on Configured Integrations.

click on Add next to slash Commands.

Command: thel [If you want to change this check explanation of the code below]

URL: {your_herokuapp_url}/thel [This can be changed see, code below]

Customize name: Give it some name. I gave it - The L

For the Autocomplete help text, check to show the command in auto-complete list.

Description: The Genius L, is now in slack to answer all your queries OR [anything you want to write].

Usage Hint: search query

Descriptive Level: Search Query

Step 6: All Done!
Open your slack channel and type /thel or [your command] and type Query.

Everything is working fine you will see the result.

Try basic Queries first for the testing purpose, it will give an instant response.

Congratulation you just created a new Slack Bot for your own Team!! Have fun! üçª

Explanation of the Code
I already explained usages of the files in the directory. I created this Slack Bot using WolframAlpha Module and Flask framework. You should know working with Python modules and all the syntax to understand the code.

<code class="language-python">**author** = 'vikesh' # this is the author name

import os # This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.
import wolframalpha

# I have used Wolframalpha module, written in python to work with Wolframalpha API.

# Read more about it here: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wolframalpha

from flask import Flask, request, Response, redirect

# Modules from Flask

try:
import config # Import config.py file
wol_id = config.wolframalpha['app_id'] # assign APP_ID from config.py to wol_id
except:
wol_id = os.environ.get('APP_ID') # load envoironment variable

if not wol_id: # if wol_id is not present display error and exit
import sys
print 'No config.py found exisiting...'
sys.exit(0)

app = Flask(**name**) # initiate flask app

client = wolframalpha.Client(wol_id) # this is from Wolframa moudule. Initiate Client using Wol_id

@app.route('/thel',methods=['post'])
def thel():
'''
:Example:
/thel current weather in mumbai?
'''
'''
this is about routing of the URL in flask.
If you want to change the command from `/thel` to something else. you have to change the app.route('/thel') to
your own command. Also change the function name.
'''
text = request.values.get('text') # Get Query
try:
res = client.query(text) # Get result from Wolframalpha API.
except UnicodeEncodeError: # if coudln't get the response show error.
return Response(('Sorry I did\'t get you. Would you please simplify your query?'
'%s is not valid input.' % text),
content_type='text\plain; charset=utf-8')
resp_qs = ['Hi Top Answer for "%s"\n' % text] # if Query is successful show result.
resp_qs.extend(next(res.results).text) # iterate the result

    return Response(''.join(resp_qs),
                    content_type='text/plain; chatset=utf-8')     # return response.

@app.route('/')
def hello(): # if someone tries to open the link directy redirect him somewhere :p
return redirect('https://github.com/vicky002/slack-TheL')

if **name** == '**main**':  
 port = int(os.environ.get('PORT',5000)) # run your app on local
app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=port)</code>
